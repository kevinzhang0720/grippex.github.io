   	<p class="description">League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre video game developed by Riot Games. Players are formed into two even teams primarily comprised of three or five members. Each team starts at opposing sides of a map, near what is called a "Nexus." To win a match, a team must destroy the opposing team's Nexus. To do so, each team must work through a series of towers called 'turrets' that are placed along three paths to each base (commonly referred to as 'lanes') Along the way, each player gains power by completing game objectives, earning them experience points and gold that are used to increase the player's level and to purchase powerful items, potentially giving players an advantage over their opponents. Examples of these objectives include killing the opposing team's turrets, players, and 'minions' (small NPCs that constantly spawn and attack the other team).</p>

   	<p class="description">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale video game developed by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Korean publisher Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were developed by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games using the 2000 film Battle Royale for inspiration, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.</p>
