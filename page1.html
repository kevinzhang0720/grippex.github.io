	    <p class="description1">I am Grippex, a part-time YouTube and Twitch streamer. I started streaming two years ago, the reason I have been doing this is because I like to play a variety of videogames with my friends, and I want to share my passion and love for games to everyone. I really like to interact with my subscribers and viewers, and sometimes I also randomly invite my subscribers to play games together. I actual job is a front-end developer, I write a lot of codes during daytime and brainstorm about new features and ideas for the webpages. But after work, I would spend the whole night playing videogames. I usually stream on weekdays from 7pm to 1am, I would take some breaks on weekend. Below are some descriptions and details of components of my gaming desktop:</p>

    	<p class="description2">I started playing videogames since I was a child. My parents bought a PlayStation 1 console as a gift for my brother’s birthday. Since then, my brother and I spent a lot of time on games. I got my first console as a gift for my 13th years birthday, it was a Nintendo Wii. I have promised my parents that I will not spent too much time on videogames but on study. However, I still played a lot of games when my parents are not at home. During last year of high-school, I started playing a computer game called League of Legends, I admit, this game is so fun that I still play a lot. After I came to college, I bought a gaming desktop and I started to play various kind of computer games. Some of the games I play include are as follow:</p>
